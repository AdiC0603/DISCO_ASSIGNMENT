Pseudocode:

1. Input the number of courses (n).
2. Initialize variables:
    a. List of faculty IDs (faculty_id)
    b. List of faculty course limits (faculty_Courselimit)
    c. 2D array for faculty preferences (faculty_preferences)
    d. List of courses (Courses)

3. Iterate for each course:
    a. Input course number and add it to the Courses list.

4. Iterate for each faculty:
    a. Input faculty ID, course limit, and preferences for each course.
    b. Update the faculty_id, faculty_Courselimit, and faculty_preferences lists.

5. Define variables for the CP-SAT model:
    a. Use symbols to create variables for the matrix (variables).
    b. Create a 2D array my_matrix based on faculty preferences.

6. Define a solution callback class (VarArraySolutionPrinter):
    a. Initialize with variables and an output file.
    b. Implement on_solution_callback to print faculty-course assignments.

7. Define a function to search for all solutions using CP-SAT:
    a. Create a CP model.
    b. Add variables to the model based on faculty preferences.
    c. Add constraints for column and row limits.
    d. Create a solver and a solution printer.
    e. Solve the model, printing solutions to the output file.

8. Specify the output file name.

9. Call the function to search for all solutions and generate the output file.

10. Optionally, print the status and the number of solutions found.

11. End.
